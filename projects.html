            A virtual stock market game that allows users to compete with their
            friends to see who can make the most money in the stock market in a
            given period of time. It was built with an Agile scrum team of
            fouras a final capstone project at Tech Elevator's 14 week coding
            bootcamp.

            The project uses <em>Java</em> and <em>Spring Boot</em>on the back

            <em>Finnhub API</em> for real-time stock data and
            <em>ECharts library</em> to display graphical data.

            TEnmo is a command-line program that allows users to send, request,
            approve, and reject 'TE Buck' transfers. I built this with a partner
            as a mini-capstone as part of my curriculum at Tech Elevator's 14

            <span class="details">How we built it:</span>
            On the server side, we used Spring's <em>JdbcTemplate</em> to send
            queries to the <em>PostgreSQL</em> database to fetch, add, or update
            information. We used the <em>Spring MVC framework</em> to open up
            endpoints for the client-side to access using <em>RestTemplate</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The client displays relevant data and interacts with the server
            based on user input. We created custom exceptions to validate user
            input and <em>Integration tests</em> to ensure everything runs
            smoothly.

          <ul class="technologies">
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>OOP</li>
            <li>JUnit Testing</li>

            <li>Test Driven Development</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span class="details">What it is: </span>
            Euchre is a 4 player trick-taking card game similar to Bridge. I
            built it for fun because it's often hard to find four players who
            know how to play the game, and its even harder to explain the rules
            to someone who hasn't played before (if you're up for a challenge,
            you can read the official rules of Euchre
            <a
              href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            In my version, up to four players can play a game against the
            computer in the command line. While playing, they can:
          </p>
          <ul class="features">
            <li>
              Select the number of players who wish to play against the computer
            </li>
            <li>
              View their cards and decide whether they want the dealer to pick
              up the top card or pass
            </li>
            <li>
              If applicable, view their cards and decide whether they want to
              call trump or pass
            </li>
            <li>Play cards in a trick based on what has already been played</li>
            <li>See who won each trick and, subsequently, who won the hand</li>
            <li>View score updates after each hand is played</li>
            <li>
              See the winner of the game once the game is over and a team has
              reached 10 points
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the game is over, decide whether they want to play again or
              end the program
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <span class="details"> How I built it: </span>
            I built Euchre following the <em>MVC design pattern</em>. Using
            <em>Java</em> and <em>Object oriented programming</em> principles, I
            was able to separate the data and logic from the display of it.
            Right now it is a command line program, but it is built to be
            extendable so that the logic can be reused with a revamped front
            end. I used <em>Test Driven Development</em> techniques to build the
            program so I could ensure that each additional piece of logic did
            what it was supposed to.

            We used <em>OOP principles</em> to design of the project, then
            implemented our plan using <em>Java</em>. We used the
            <em>Scanner</em> class to read in inventory from a CSV file,
            instantiating objects of the relevant class that stores price, name,
            and slot information. A VendingMachine class contains all the logic
            for inventory management and feeding and dispensing money, and
            another Scanner object allowed us to read and respond to user input
            in the command line. We also wrote <em>JUnit tests</em>
            to ensure all the logic worked as intended.

            >. The returned <em>JSON</em> string is parsed to pull out and
            display relevant information to the screen and reposition the map.
            Each time the user searches, the process is repeated to show them
            updated details for that IP address or domain.
